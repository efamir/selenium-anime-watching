# selenium-anime-watching
A simple python selenium program based on firefox browser that automatically skips openings/endings and plays the next episodes on jut.su anime site.

This program needs the selenium library to be installed. To install the library you can run "pip install selenium" in the terminal.

If your OS is Windows program probably won't work. To fix this program, edit main.py code.

If your OS is Linux, you can simply run this command: "git clone https://github.com/efamir/selenium-anime-watching.git && pip install selenium".

To run the program, open main.py file. Firstly, you will need to login into your jut.su account, then press Enter key in the program's terminal. After that program is ready.
